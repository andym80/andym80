Hello! I am a highly motivated individual with a strong desire to work with a tech company that can create a positive social impact. I have experience working as a Sound Designer, where I learned how to collaborate effectively with remote teams. Recently, I have been expanding my knowledge and skills in coding and web development, and I have even built my own interfaces since starting last year.

Currently, I am pursuing my passion for technology at Microverse, an online training school where I code for 8 hours a day alongside developers from all around the world. I am eager to learn and grow as much as possible, and I have gained valuable communication and teamwork skills through this experience.

I would love to discuss my background and aspirations with you in more detail. Please feel free to reach out to me at any time. <br>
