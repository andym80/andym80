# Hello, I'm Andy Menutti

# About Me:
#Full-Stack Developer<br>
#Sr.Sound designer focus on UX<br> 
I find solutions at every display you'll present to me. 

  I'm on a mission to work and innovate with a strong tech company one day, mostly with social impact.I previously worked as a Sound Designer where I learned how to use Javascript & Tensorflow. Now I'm increasing my knowledge in coding & web development. I have built my own interfaces since I started last year. Currently, I am studying at Microverse, an online training school where I code 8 hours a day remotely with other developers from all over the world and have learned the skills of communication and teamwork.<br>
Would you be open to discussing further with me? <br>
